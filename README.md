Utopia Queue is base library for building Utopia style servers. This library is aiming to be as simple and easy to learn and use. This library is maintained by the [Appwrite team](https://appwrite.io).

Although this library is part of the [Utopia](https://github.com/utopia-php/framework) project it is dependency free and can be used as standalone with any other PHP project or framework.

## Getting Started

Install using composer:

```bash
composer require utopia-php/servers
```

Init in your application:

```php
<?php

require_once __DIR__ . '/../../vendor/autoload.php';

// TBD
```

## System Requirements

Utopia Framework requires PHP 8.0 or later. We recommend using the latest PHP version whenever possible.
